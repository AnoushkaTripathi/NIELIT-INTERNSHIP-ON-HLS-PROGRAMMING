HLS in Industries
 - NVIDIA for designing embedded GPU
 - Google in building VP9 encoder/decoder
 - AMD in desigining Microprocessor
 - STM for H.265



Why do we need FPGA?

FPGA and CPU both can have logic synthesis

CPU have a OS on it whereas FPGA don't than why should we work with FPGA

FPGA Vs CPU

| FPGA | CPU | 
|----------|----------|
| Computing platform with no predefined hardware architecture,each C/C++ program we create have it's own optimized hardware architecture| CPUs are computing platform with fixed hardware architecture, generic to perform any logical algorithmic function as long as it is compiled into CPU instructions|
